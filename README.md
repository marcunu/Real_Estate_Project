# Real_Estate_Project

Have you ever wanted to buy a property but didn't know if it was the right time or if the price was right?

This project is based on a database of more than 16 000 homes with which a machine learning algorithm has been created, this algorithm is based on different characteristics:

* m2 built
* m2 useful
* Number of rooms
* Number of bathrooms
* Floors
* House type
* Is new development?
* is renewal needed?
* Has parking?
* is exterior?
* Energy certificate

## Goal

The aim of this project is to create a price comparator of the real estate market, this comparator can help you to know:

* Market price: the algorithm assigns a market value based on the characteristics you have entered.
* Rental price: the algorithm assigns a rental price based on the characteristics.

## Steps

* `Get a database` with the information.
* `Clean-up` the dataset.
* Create a Database in `SQL`.
* Get info via `queries`.
* Create a `streamlit app`.
* Deploy streamlit app with `heroku`.
